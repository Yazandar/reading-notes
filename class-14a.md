## CSS Trasformars

* The ```transfor```m property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

* The actual ```syntax``` for the ```transform``` property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

* Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth.

* The ```transform``` property accepts a handful of different values. The ```rotate``` value provides the ability to rotate an element from ```0``` to ```360``` degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise. The default point of rotation is the center of the element, ```50% 50%```, both horizontally and vertically.

* Using the ```scale``` value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to 1.01 makes an element appear larger.

* The ```translate``` value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document. Using the translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis while using the translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis.

* ```skew``` value is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both. The syntax is very similar to that of the scale and translate values. Using the skewX value distorts an element on the horizontal axis while the skewY value distorts an element on the vertical axis. To distort an element on both axes the skew value is used, declaring the x axis value first, followed by a comma, and then the y axis value.%p.

* the default ```transform origin``` is the dead center of an element, both 50% horizontally and 50% vertically. To change this default origin position the transform-origin property may be used.

* The ```transform-origin``` property can accept one or two values. When only one value is specified, that value is used for both the horizontal and vertical axes. If two values are specified, the first is used for the horizontal axis and the second is used for the vertical axis.

* In order for three-dimensional transforms to work the elements need a perspective from which to transform. The perspective for each element can be thought of as a vanishing point, similar to that which can be seen in three-dimensional drawings.

* Using the ```perspective``` value within the ```transform``` property works great for transforming one element from a single, unique perspective. When you want to transform a group of elements all with the same perspective, or vanishing point, apply the perspective property to their parent element.

* As with setting a transform-origin you can also set a perspective-origin. The same values used for the transform-origin property may also be used with the perspective-origin property, and maintain the same relationship to the element. The large difference between the two falls where the origin of a transform determines the coordinates used to calculate the change of a transform, while the origin of a perspective identifies the coordinates of the vanishing point of a transform.

* Using the rotateX value allows you to rotate an element around the x axis, as if it were being bent in half horizontally. Using the rotateY value allows you to rotate an element around the y axis, as if it were being bent in half vertically. Lastly, using the rotateZ value allows an element to be rotated around the z axis.

* Skew is the one two-dimensional transform that cannot be transformed on a three-dimensional scale. Elements may be skewed on the x and y axis, then transformed three-dimensionally as wished, but they cannot be skewed on the z axis.

* The transform-style property needs to be placed on the parent element, above any nested transforms. The preserve-3d value allows the transformed children elements to appear in their own three-dimensional plane while the flat value forces the transformed children elements to lie flat on the two-dimensional plane.

* The other value to backface-visibility is visible which is the default value, always displaying an element, no matter which direction it faces.

## Transitions & Animations

* transition is to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

* The transition-property property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties. By default, all of the properties within an elementâ€™s different states will be altered upon change. However, only the properties identified within the transition-property value will be affected by any transitions.

* It is important to note, not all properties may be transitioned, only properties that have an identifiable halfway point. Colors, font sizes, and the alike may be transitioned from one value to another as they have recognizable values in-between one another. The display property, for example, may not be transitioned as it does not have any midpoint.

* The duration in which a transition takes place is set using the transition-duration property. The value of this property can be set using general timing values, including seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms). These timing values may also come in fractional measurements.

* The transition-timing-function property is used to set the speed in which a transition will move. Knowing the duration from the transition-duration property a transition can have multiple speeds within a single duration. A few of the more popular keyword values for the transition-timing-function property include linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out.

* The linear keyword value identifies a transition moving in a constant speed from one state to another. The ease-in value identifies a transition that starts slowly and speeds up throughout the transition, while the ease-out value identifies a transition that starts quickly and slows down throughout the transition. The ease-in-out value identifies a transition that starts slowly, speeds up in the middle, then slows down again before ending.

* When transitioning multiple properties, you can identify multiple timing functions. These timing function values, as with other transition property values, may be declared as comma separated values.

* On top of declaring the transition property, duration, and timing function, you can also set a delay with the transition-delay property. The delay sets a time value, seconds or milliseconds, that determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing. As with all other transition properties, to delay numerous transitions, each delay can be declared as comma separated values.

* Declaring every transition property individually can become quite intensive, especially with vendor prefixes. Fortunately there is a shorthand property, transition, capable of supporting all of these different properties and values. Using the transition value alone, you can set every transition value in the order of transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and lastly transition-delay. Do not use commas with these values unless you are identifying numerous transitions.

* To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.

* On top of being able to set the number of times an animation repeats, you may also declare the direction an animation completes using the animation-direction property. Values for the animation-direction property include normal, reverse, alternate, and alternate-reverse.

* The normal value plays an animation as intended from beginning to end. The reverse value will play the animation exactly opposite as identified within the @keyframes rule, thus starting at 100% and working backwards to 0%.

* The animation-play-state property allows an animation to be played or paused using the running and paused keyword values respectively. When you play a paused animation, it will resume running from its current state rather than starting from the very beginning again.

* The animation-fill-mode property identifies how an element should be styled either before, after, or before and after an animation is run. The animation-fill-mode property accepts four keyword values, including none, forwards, backwards, and both.

* The none value will not apply any styles to an element before or after an animation has been run.

* The forwards value will keep the styles declared within the last specified keyframe. These styles may, however, be affected by the animation-direction and animation-iteration-count property values, changing exactly where an animation ends.

* The backwards value will apply the styles within the first specified keyframe as soon as being identified, before the animation has been run. This does include applying those styles during any time that may be set within an animation delay. The backwards value may also be affected by the animation-direction property value.
