* ```<body>``` element indicates what appear in main browser window.

* ```<head>``` contains the web page's information, and usually you will find the ```<title>``` element inside it.

## Extra Markup

* There have been several ```HTML``` versions, and now we are using ```HTML5```.

* Using ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` declaration, we are telling the browser that we are using ```HTML5```.

* Its Useful to use comments in the code, to explain to yourself later the code, or to others. Use ```<!-- comment -->``` for comments.

* ```id``` attribute can be carried by ```HTML``` element to identfy it uniquely, and giving an element a unique identity allows to style it specifically. also known as global attribute because it can be used on any element.

* ```HTML``` elements also can carry ```class``` attribute, used to identify several elements as being different from the others.

* Block elemnts used to start a new line, such as ```h1```,```<p>``` and ```<ul>```.

* Inline elements used to continue on the same line, such as ```<a>``` and ```<img>```.

* ```<div>``` element used to group set of elements togother in one block. Using ```<div>``` element make it easier to follow the code.

* ```<span>``` element act like an inline equivalent of ```<div>```.

* ```<iframe>``` used to add a little window in your web page from another page. this element use attributes : ```src```, ```height``` and ```width```.

* ```<meta>``` element in the ```<head>``` element, contains informmation about the web page, used for number of purposes such as telling search engines about your page. And its an empty elemnt (does not need closing tag). Attributes here used commonly  : describtion, keywords, and rabots. also used http-equiv and content attributes such ass author, pragma, and expires.

## Process and Design

Understanding your taget audience would help you in designing your web page.

* To understand your audience ask yourself

1. Why would they visit your website?
    what would motivate them to ? look for key motivations.
    what is visitor specific goal?

1. What visitors are trying to achieve?

1. What information your visitor need?

1. How often people will visit your site?

### Site Maps

Site map helps to organize you website information, its you site's structure. Card sorting is good technique to decide what information should go on each page.

### Wireframes

Its your graphical plan or your website blueprint that shows the hierarchy of the information.

### Navigation 

Site navigation helps people to find where they want to go, and understand what the site is about.

* Navigayion should follow these principles 
    * Concise
    * Clear
    * Selective
    * Context
    * Interactive
    * Consistent

## The ABC Of Programming

* a script is series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

* To write a script, first state your goal then list the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to achieve it.

* start with the big picture then  break it down into smaller steps.
    1. Define your goal
    1. Design the script
    1. Code each step
