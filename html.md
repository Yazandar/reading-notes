## Commen Used

* ```<nav>```

    The ```<nav>``` element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

* ```<article>```
    
    The```<article>``` element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.    
* ```<aside>```
    
    The ```<aside>``` element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an ```<article>``` element or not.
    * inside an ```<article>``` element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning.
    * When the ```<aside>``` element is used outside of an ```<article>``` element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.

* ```<section>```
    
    The ```<section>``` element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading. 
* ```<hgroup>```

    The purpose of the ```<hgroup>``` element is to group together a set of one or more ```<h1>``` through ```<h6>``` elements so that they are treated as one single heading.       
* ```<div>```

    ```<div>``` element is an important way to group together related elements.
