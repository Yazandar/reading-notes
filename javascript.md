# JavaScript

* JavaScript allows to make web pages more interactive, by responding to what user does.

    1. Access content
        * You can use JavaScript to select any element.
        * Find out what was entered into a text input.
    1. Modify content
        * You can Use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them.
    1. Program rules
        * You can specify set of steps for the browser to follow.
    1. React to events
        * you can specity that a script should run when a specific event occures.

## Writing a Script

1. State your goal, then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. Starting with big picture of what you want to achieve, and break it down into similar steps.
    * Define your goal
    * Design the script
    * Code each step

* A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.

* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.

* Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.

* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

## Epressions

* An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
  1. epression that just assign a value to a variable.

  ```var color = black```

  2. epression that use two or more values to return a single value.

  ```var area = 5 * 9```

--------------

## Operaters

* Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
    * Arithmetic operators

    * String operator
        * There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it. 

--------------

## Functions

* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function, rather than repeating the same set of statements.
* Declaring a function
    * To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.

* Calling function
    * Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just oneline of code.

* Declaring functions that need information
    * Sometimes function needs a specific information to perform its task. In such cases, when declare the function you give it a parameters. Inside the function the parameters act like variables.

* Getting a single value of function
    * Some functions return information to the code that called them. For example, when they perform a calculation, they return the result.
