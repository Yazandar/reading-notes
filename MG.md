# Growth Mindset
> ### It's a belief that encourages the constant improvement of one's potentials and abilities, it's helpful way of thinking to get things done no mater how hard they were.

For me in order to keep this mindset I remind myself with :
1. ### Challenges
    * >challenge is hard at it's first hit, facing it and dealing with it will make it easier.

1. ### Effort
    * >pursuing and working hard will always pay off.

1. ### Criticism  
* >always assess yourself, to find out things you are good at, and the things you should improve yourself in.
