## **Text Editor** 
 Is software that you download on your computer, allows you to write and manage the text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.

### Most important features are :
 * code completion.
 * syntax highlighting.
 * a nice varity of themes.
 * and the ability to choose from healthy selections of extensions available when you need them.

Text editors are different, most of them are free and some are not, some of them can be used on a specific OS, and each text editor support different kind of coding languages.

Software developer should think before using one of them, choosing one of them depends what language you want to use, and what other features are needed.
