## Images

* You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

* By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block.

* The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

* When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.

* Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a rollover) and a third style when they click on it.

* If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible.

## Practical Information

* SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject. The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can improve your website's visibility on search engines.

* In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords (the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order to improve its findability:
    1. Page Title
    2. URL / Web Address
    3. Heading
    4. Text
    5. Link Text
    6. Image Alt Text
    7. Page Descriptions

* Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site:
    1. Brainstorm
    2. Oraganize
    3. Reaserch
    4. Compare
    5. Refine
    6. Map

* As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by Google called Google Analytics.

* The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are coming to your site.

* The content link on the left-hand side allows you to learn more about what the visitors are looking at when they come to your site.

* To transfer your code and images from your computer to your hosting company, you use something known as File Transfer Protocol.
